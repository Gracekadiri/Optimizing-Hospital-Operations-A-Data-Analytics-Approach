# Optimizing Hospital Operations: A Data Analytics Simulation for Systemwide Insight
## Introduction
This end-to-end analytics project simulates hospital operations in a low-resource context, using synthetic data to model decisions around patient flow, resource strain, and financial performance.

I used SQL, Power BI, and Python to track KPIs across admissions, staffing, equipment use, and payer models. The goal was to simulate what a real hospital analyst would do to support triage, burnout prevention, profitability, and care access — all in one dashboard.

## Key Contributions:

Built multi-layered dashboard with clinical, staffing, and financial indicators

Surfaced bottlenecks in wait times, equipment use, and shift design

Modeled cost-per-patient and payer mix to support revenue strategy

Recommended changes to bed reallocation, preventive maintenance, and scheduling

Translated data into 8 concrete operational decisions

## Project Overview
Hospitals in Nigeria often face challenges in tracking patient care, resource allocation, and operational efficiency due to limited access to real-time data. This dashboard aims to address that by providing a tool to monitor critical KPIs, enabling data-driven decision-making. Although built with synthetic data, the project demonstrates how analytics can transform hospital management.



## Tools Used
- SQL: For querying and aggregating hospital data.
- Python: For generating synthetic hospital data (using Pandas, NumPy, Faker).
- Power BI: For building interactive visualizations and dashboards.


## Data
The dashboard uses synthetic data generated with Python’s Faker library to simulate realistic hospital operations, including:
- Patient demographics and admissions.
- Staff assignments and shifts.
- Financial transactions (billing and expenses).
- Equipment and bed usage.
This data mimics real-world scenarios but is entirely fictional, ensuring privacy and compliance.

## Dashboard Features
The dashboard consists of four interactive pages:
- Overview: High-level metrics like total patients, average length of stay, bed occupancy, and total revenue.
- Patient Flow & Trends: Visualizes admissions, discharges, patient demographics, and top diagnoses.
- Resource Utilization: Tracks bed occupancy by department, staff-to-patient ratios, and equipment usage.
- Financial Performance: Monitors revenue, expenses, cost per patient, and profitability trends.

## Key Insights from Analysis
-	ER & ICU have high bed occupancy rates (91.67% and 100%, respectively), while General Ward has only 47.37% occupancy, indicating inefficient bed distribution.
-	Peak admission hours are 3 AM and 7 AM, with the highest patient volume on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, requiring additional staff coverage during these periods.
-	ER has the shortest consultation wait time (34 minutes), but Pediatrics, Cardiology, and ICU patients wait over 100 minutes, leading to patient dissatisfaction.
-	Cardiology nurses handle the highest patient load (1,837 patients per nurse), followed by ICU (1,710) and Pediatrics (1,440), increasing staff burnout risks.
- Night shift staffs work an average of 9 hours per shift
- Some medical equipment such as the Infant Warmer, Oxygen Concentrator, and Ventilator has exceeded recommended usage hours, increasing breakdown risks and potential equipment failure during critical care.
- NHIS and Private HMO patients have the lowest profit margins (17.6–17.9%), making them less financially sustainable compared to self-pay patients. Although NHIS patients generate a higher average bill per patient (₦161K) than self-pay patients (₦146K), higher associated expenses and lower reimbursement rates limit overall hospital profitability.


## Final Summary of Key Actions
- Reallocate 20 beds from General Ward to ER & ICU to reduce overcrowding. Expand ICU by converting underused wards into step-down units for stable patients.
- Hire additional ER & ICU doctors and nurses to reduce patient wait times and prevent staff burnout.
- Implement digital queue management to streamline check-ins and reduce consultation wait times.
- Perform preventive maintenance on overused Infant Warmers, Oxygen Concentrators, and Ventilators to prevent equipment failure.
- Rotate underutilized equipment, such as X-ray machines, to high-demand departments for better utilization.
- Adjust staffing schedules to ensure more staff are available during peak admission hours (3 AM and 7 AM) and high-volume days (Tuesdays & Wednesdays).
- Increase self-pay services by marketing premium healthcare options, including VIP consultation services, to attract more self-pay patients and improve revenue.
- Negotiate higher NHIS reimbursement rates to increase hospital profitability and reduce reliance on low-margin insurance patients.
